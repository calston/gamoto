# gamoto
Gamoto is a simple python based OpenVPN web portal which allows users to configure their own connection via Google OAuth and Google Authenticator.

It also provides an admin interface for creating limited network access to resources per user/group. These permissions are automatically setup in iptables on connection to the VPN.

A set of Ansible scripts are provided to install and configure all the relevant components.
